  <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
  <p>
    We all depend on crops as a major part of our global food supply, and as a
    result, the swift detection of crop diseases is essential to maximizing the
    output of our fields and ensuring the health of the ingredients used in
    everyday products. However, manual detection of plant diseases is tedious;
    during the process of identification, disease continues to propagate
    rapidly. It also requires a high level of expertise and can be highly error
    prone [3]. Many of these reasons have spurred research efforts to use
    machine learning and deep learning to train models to identify diseased
    plants as well as the specific type of disease in order to aid in quick
    prevention of the spread of harmful blights that can ruin fields of crops.
    For example, Kurlkarni et al. predicted several types of diseases each for
    images of five species of crops using a random forest classifier and was
    able to achieve an average accuracy of 93% [4]. Other papers have ventured
    beyond traditional machine learning methods; one group used CNNs to classify
    a dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves to achieve a 99.3% accuracy
    [1]. We plan to use the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,303 images
    of healthy and diseased plant leaves from 13 species, including apples,
    corn, grapes, and tomatoes, with various diseases such as black rot, common
    rust, and bacterial spot. It can be found

    >.

  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <p>
    The health of our crops is crucial for meeting our daily needs.
    Unfortunately, many people lack the knowledge to accurately identify
    diseases in their plants. To address this issue, we are working on
    developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between healthy and
    unhealthy leaf images across various plant species and diseases. Our model
    could have significant applications in the agriculture industry, as
    detecting diseased plants is essential for ensuring food security and
    protecting ecosystems from harm.
  </p>
  <h2>Preprocessing Methods</h2>
  <h4>Contrast Enhancement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize scikit-image library (the rescale_intensity method) to increase
      the contrast in the plant images, which would make it easier for our CNN
      model to identify the plants from the background.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Smoothing Edges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize gaussian function within the skimage.filters module to smooth
      edges and remove noise from the leaf images. Using the gaussian function
      on the plant images would remove any unnecessary features that don't
      correlate with disease in the plant leaves, helping our algorithms perform
      better.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Grayscale</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize rgb2gray method from the skimage.color module to convert the
      colored plant leaf images to grayscale. Training our model with grayscale
      images would help eliminate color bias from the model and minimize the
      computational complexity of training.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Algorithms/Models</h2>
  <h4>Convolutional Neural Network</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) through TensorFlow by using
      Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers. First, the image features will be
      extracted with convolutional layers. Then, with the FC layers and feature
      information, the model will conclude whether the leaf is from a healthy or
      unhealthy plant.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Decision Tree Classifier</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use DecisionTreeClassifier class from Scikit to classify leaf data into
      classes of being healthy or unhealthy. Scikit used the CART
      (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm to back its decision tree
      classifier, which diverges from the C4.5 algorithm in that it doesn't
      compute rule sets.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Bagging Classifier</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier to classify our data. This
      classifier works by forming predictions based on randomized subsets of
      data. By combining the predictions, the classifier forms a final
      prediction. By randomizing, this classifier is useful since it reduces
      variance, helping reduce overfitting.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantitative Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Accuracy:</b> proportion of correctly identified diseased plants</li>
    <li><b>Precision:</b> True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)</li>
    <li><b>Recall:</b> True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)</li>
    <li><b>F1 Score:</b> Harmonic mean of precision and recall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Goals/Expected Results</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to develop an effective model to identify diseased and healthy
    plants. We aim to achieve a classification accuracy, precision, recall rate,
    and F1 Score above 0.90.
