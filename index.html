    <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
    <p>
      We all depend on crops as a major part of our global food supply, and as a
      result, the swift detection of crop diseases is essential to maximizing
      the output of our fields and ensuring the health of the ingredients used
      in everyday products. However, manual detection of plant diseases is
      tedious and slow; during the process of identification, disease continues
      to propagate rapidly. It also requires a high level of expertise, and even
      so, can be highly error prone [3]. Many of these reasons have spurred
      research efforts to use machine learning techniques, like random forest
      classifiers, to identify specific types of disease in certain crops in
      order to aid in quick prevention of the spread of harmful blights [2].
      Other papers have ventured beyond traditional machine learning methods;
      one group used CNNs to classify a dataset of diseased and healthy plant
      leaves to achieve a 99.3% accuracy [1]. We plan to use the PlantVillage
      dataset, which contains 54,303 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves
      from 13 species. It can be found here.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to develop a machine learning model that can differentiate between
      whether a given leaf image is healthy or unhealthy across a variety of
      species and diseases.
    </p>
    <h2>Preprocessing Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Contrast Enhancement We can utilize the scikit-image library (more
      specifically, the rescale_intensity method) to increase the contrast in
      the plant images, which would make it easier for our CNN model to identify
      the plants from the background. Smoothing edges We can utilize the
      gaussian function within the skimage.filters module to smooth edges and
      remove noise from the plant leaf images. Using the gaussian function on
      the plant images would remove any unnecessary features that don't
      correlate with disease in the plant leaves, helping our ML algorithms
      perform better. Grayscale We can utilize the rgb2gray method from the
      skimage.color module to convert the colored plant leaf images to
      grayscale. Training our machine learning model with both colored as well
      as grayscale images would help the model identify disease utilizing the
      color of the leaf as well as other important features (such as
      lesions/spots).
    </p>
    <h2>3+ ML Algorithms/Models Identified</h2>
    <p>
      Convolutional Neural Network We can train a Convolutional Neural Network
      (CNN) through TensorFlow by using Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers. First,
      the image features will be extracted with convolutional layers. Then, with
      the FC layers and feature information, the model will conclude whether the
      leaf is from a healthy or unhealthy plant. Decision Tree Classifier The
      DecisionTreeClassifier class from Scikit can be used to classify leaf data
      into classes of being healthy or unhealthy. Scikit used the CART
      (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm to back its decision tree
      classifier, which diverges from the C4.5 algorithm in that it doesn’t
      compute rule sets. A Bagging Classifier We could use
      sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier to classify our data. This classifier
      works by choosing randomized subsets of data to classify. Then, by
      combining the predictions from the randomized subsets, the classifier
      forms a final prediction. By randomizing, this classifier is useful since
      it reduces variance, helping reduce overfitting.

    <h2>3+ Quantitative Metrics</h2>
    <p>
      Accuracy: Measure the proportion of correctly identified diseased plants:
      metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, *[, ...]) Precision: Measure
      proportion of correctly identified diseased plants out of all plants
      identified as diseased (true positives/true positives + false positives):
      metrics.average_precision_score(y_true, ...) Recall: Measure proportion of
      correctly identified diseased plants out of all actually diseased plants
      (true positives/true positives + false negatives):
      metrics.recall_score(y_true, y_pred, *[, ...]) F1 Score: Harmonic mean of
      precision and recall: metrics.f1_score(y_true, y_pred, *[, ...]) Other
      options: Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC Score
    </p>
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, our goal is to develop an effective model to identify
      diseased and healthy plants. We hope our model will have a classification
      accuracy above 90% detection for healthy vs unhealthy. We aim for
      precision and recall rates above 0.90 to indicate less false positives and
      negatives as well as resulting F1 Score around 0.90 to indicate a balance
      in the precision and recall.
