  <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
  <p>
    We all depend on crops as a major part of our global food supply, and as a
    result, the swift detection of crop diseases is essential to maximizing the
    output of our fields and ensuring the health of the ingredients used in
    everyday products. However, manual detection of plant diseases is tedious;
    during the process of identification, disease continues to propagate
    rapidly. It also requires a high level of expertise and can be highly error
    prone [3]. Many of these reasons have spurred research efforts to use
    machine learning and deep learning to train models to identify diseased
    plants as well as the specific type of disease in order to aid in quick
    prevention of the spread of harmful blights that can ruin fields of crops.
    For example, Kurlkarni et al. predicted several types of diseases each for
    images of five species of crops using a random forest classifier and was
    able to achieve an average accuracy of 93% [4]. Other papers have ventured
    beyond traditional machine learning methods; one group used CNNs to classify
    a dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves to achieve a 99.3% accuracy
    [1].
  </p>
  <p>
    We plan to use the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,303 images of
    healthy and diseased plant leaves from 13 species, including apples, corn,
    grapes, and tomatoes, with various diseases such as black rot, common rust,
    and bacterial spot. It can be found

    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <p>
    The health of our crops is crucial for meeting our daily needs.
    Unfortunately, many people lack the knowledge to accurately identify
    diseases in their plants. To address this issue, we are working on
    developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between healthy and
    unhealthy leaf images across various plant species and diseases. Our model
    could have significant applications in the agriculture industry, as
    detecting diseased plants is essential for ensuring food security and
    protecting ecosystems from harm.
  </p>
  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <p>
    In order to preprocess our images, we utilized a grayscale method to create
    a grayscale version of the PlantVillage dataset. Opting for grayscale as our
    preprocessing technique allowed us to remove color bias from the model and
    reduce computational complexity. For image classification, we employed a
    decision tree model. We selected a decision tree for training as it is known
    for its simplicity in computation compared to other models, yet remains
    highly effective in hierarchically classifying images.
  </p>

  <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
  <h4>Visualizations:</h4>
  <p>
    When running our decision tree model, we trained on different percentages of
    the Plant Village dataset due to the computational complexity and time
    involved in training. Below is a visualization of the model accuracy when
    trained with different percentages of the Plant Village dataset:

  <h4>Quantitative Metrics</h4>

  <h5>Project Goals/Expected Results</h5>
  <p> In this project, our goal is to develop an effective model to identify diseased 
    and healthy plants. Our model will first take a leaf image of a plant conducting 
    preprocessing to extract key features from the image such as identifying 
    possible areas of lesions. We hope our model will have a classification accuracy 
    above 90% detection for healthy vs unhealthy. This would indicate that our model 
    can be trusted to give correct information, allowing more confident use when 
    applied to the agricultural field. Some current models have achieved 96% 
    accuracy such as the DBN [3]. Therefore, we’ve also set a similar more reasonable goal 
    for our model given our resources. Likewise, we aim for precision and recall rates 
    above 0.90 to indicate fewer false positives and negatives as well as resulting F1 
    Score around 0.90. A high precision rate is critical in terms of the losses associated 
    with false positives. If the model falsely classifies a crop as diseased, it could 
    result in resources wasted on preventing the spread of disease or the extermination of 
    healthy plants. A high recall rate is important for mitigating the risks of false 
    negatives. If the model fails to classify a diseased crop, the disease would spread, 
    killing fields of crops and resulting in significant economic loss for farms. 
    The derived F1 Score is a concise representation of both false positives and negatives 
    and an overall balance in precision and recall. </p>
  
  <h5>Resulting Metrics</h5>
  <p>The metrics for our decision tree classifier were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Accuracy:</b> 0.262706</li>
    <li><b>Precision:</b> 0.262706</li>
    <li><b>Recall:</b> 0.262174</li>
    <li><b>F1 Score:</b> 0.251980</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Analysis of Decision Tree</h4>
  <p>
    As seen in our metrics, though the decision tree classifier made significant
    progress from randomly guessing what disease a plant has, its accuracy is
    still relatively low. This could be due to several reasons. Firstly,
    decision tree models are not the best choice for image data, as image data
    is high-dimensional (for example, our 256 x 256 pixel dataset led to 65,536
    features for the decision tree). Additionally, decision trees consider each
    feature separately without incorporating spatial information, which is
    highly ineffective for image data. Finally, since our preprocessing
    mechanism involved gray-scaling the images, this may have led to loss of
    some valuable information that resulted in a lower accuracy of the model.
    Thus, the relatively low accuracy for the decision tree trained on
    PlantVillage is relatively expected.
  </p>

  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
  <p>
    Our next steps involve training a CNN (convolutional neural network) to
    classify plant diseases from the Plant Village dataset. We expect that our
    CNN model will be much more accurate, as CNNs are optimized and built to
    find patterns in and classify images. They eliminate all the drawbacks
    mentioned as the causes for low accuracy in our decision tree model, as they
    can accommodate the high-dimensional data associated with images, and use
    convolutions to detect important features in images. In addition to training
    models such as CNNs on our data, we also plan to investigate other
    pre-processing mechanisms; for example, we plan to run PCA (Principal
    Component Analysis) on the images to reduce the complexity of the input
    space.
