  <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
  <p>
    The swift detection of crop diseases is essential to maximizing global food
    supply. However, manual detection of plant diseases is inefficient; it
    requires a high level of expertise and can be highly error prone [3]. This
    has spurred research to use machine learning techniques, like random forest
    classifiers, to identify crop diseases in order to prevent the spread of
    harmful blights [2]. Other papers have ventured beyond traditional machine
    learning methods; one group used CNNs to classify a dataset of diseased and
    healthy plant leaves to achieve a 99.3% accuracy [1]. We plan to use the
    PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,303 images of healthy and diseased
    plant leaves from 13 species. It can be found
    <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village">here</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to develop a machine learning model that can differentiate between
    whether a given leaf image is healthy or unhealthy across a variety of
    species and diseases.
  </p>
  <h2>Preprocessing Methods</h2>
  <h4>Contrast Enhancement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize scikit-image library (the rescale_intensity method) to increase
      the contrast in the plant images, which would make it easier for our CNN
      model to identify the plants from the background.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Smoothing Edges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize gaussian function within the skimage.filters module to smooth
      edges and remove noise from the leaf images. Using the gaussian function
      on the plant images would remove any unnecessary features that don't
      correlate with disease in the plant leaves, helping our algorithms perform
      better.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Grayscale</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Utilize rgb2gray method from the skimage.color module to convert the
      colored plant leaf images to grayscale. Training our model with both
      colored as well as grayscale images would help the model identify disease
      utilizing the color of the leaf as well as other important features such
      as lesions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Algorithms/Models</h2>
  <h4>Convolutional Neural Network</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) through TensorFlow by using
      Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers. First, the image features will be
      extracted with convolutional layers. Then, with the FC layers and feature
      information, the model will conclude whether the leaf is from a healthy or
      unhealthy plant.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Decision Tree Classifier</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use DecisionTreeClassifier class from Scikit to classify leaf data into
      classes of being healthy or unhealthy. Scikit used the CART
      (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm to back its decision tree
      classifier, which diverges from the C4.5 algorithm in that it doesn't
      compute rule sets.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Bagging Classifier</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier to classify our data. This
      classifier works by forming predictions based on randomized subsets of
      data. By combining the predictions, the classifier forms a final
      prediction. By randomizing, this classifier is useful since it reduces
      variance, helping reduce overfitting.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quantitative Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Accuracy:</b> proportion of correctly identified diseased plants</li>
    <li><b>Precision:</b> True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)</li>
    <li><b>Recall:</b> True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)</li>
    <li><b>F1 Score:</b> Harmonic mean of precision and recall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Goals/Expected Results</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to develop an effective model to identify diseased and healthy
    plants. We aim to achieve a classification accuracy, precision, recall rate,
    and F1 Score above 0.90.
